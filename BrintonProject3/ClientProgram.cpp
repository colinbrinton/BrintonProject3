* Method: main()
*
* Method Description
* ------------------
* This client code provides tests for the following "NumDays" required methods
* and Operators:
* 1.  Default Constructor: Sets hours worked to 0
* 2.  Initializing Constructor: hours worked
* 3.  getDays(): Number of whole days for the hours worked
* 4.  getHours(): Number of residual hours after whole days calculated
* 5.  addHours(double): Add hours to the Class object
* 6.  Operator Addition: Adds hours of two Class objects, RETurns a Class object
* 7.  Operator Subtraction: Subtract's one Class hours from another
* 8.  Combined Subtraction Operator: Subtracts hours from one object
* 9.  Prefix Increment Operator: Increments class object's hours by 1 hour
* 10. Postfix Increment Operator: Increments class object's hours by 1 hour
* 11. Prefix Decrement Operator: Decrements class object's hours by 1 hour
* 10. Postfix Decrement Operator: Decrements class object's hours by 1 hour
* 11. Stream Insertion Operator: Inserts days/hours worked into stream object
